	      	<h2>Overview</h2>
	        <p>
	        I grew up in Orlando FL after moving to the U.S. from Medellin, Colombia in '99 and am currently in Ithaca, NY at Cornell University wrapping up my Master's of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering.

	        <h2 >Motivations</h2>
	        <p>
	        Professionaly I'd describe myself as a mechanical engineer by trade, jack-of-all-trades at heart. I take an inter-disciplinary approach to engineering and take no greater joy at work than wearing multiple hats. My current professional interests lie in robotics and electronic consumer products and my ambition is to help create new ways to empower people and provide them with experiences that make them say "woah.".
